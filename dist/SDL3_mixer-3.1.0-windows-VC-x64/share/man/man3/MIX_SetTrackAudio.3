.SH NAME
MIX_SetTrackAudio \- Set a 
.BR MIX_Track
's input to a 
.BR MIX_Audio
\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_SetTrackAudio(MIX_Track *track, MIX_Audio *audio);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A 
.BR MIX_Audio
 is audio data stored in RAM (possibly still in a
compressed form)\[char46] One 
.BR MIX_Audio
 can be assigned to multiple
tracks at once\[char46]

Once a track has a valid input, it can start mixing sound by calling

.BR MIX_PlayTrack
(), or possibly 
.BR MIX_PlayTag
()\[char46]

Calling this function with a NULL audio input is legal, and removes any
input from the track\[char46] If the track was currently playing, the next time the
mixer runs, it'll notice this and mark the track as stopped, calling any
assigned 
.BR MIX_TrackStoppedCallback
\[char46]

It is legal to change the input of a track while it's playing, however some
states, like loop points, may cease to make sense with the new audio\[char46] In
such a case, one can call 
.BR MIX_PlayTrack
 again to adjust
parameters\[char46]

The track will hold a reference to the provided 
.BR MIX_Audio
, so
it is safe to call 
.BR MIX_DestroyAudio
() on it while the
track is still using it\[char46] The track will drop its reference (and possibly
free the resources) once it is no longer using the 
.BR MIX_Audio
\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track on which to set a new audio input\[char46]
.TP
.I audio
the new audio input to set\[char46] May be NULL\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success, false on error; call SDL_GetError() for
details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
