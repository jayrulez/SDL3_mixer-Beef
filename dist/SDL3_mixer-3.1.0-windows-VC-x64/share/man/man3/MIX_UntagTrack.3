.SH NAME
MIX_UntagTrack \- Remove an arbitrary tag from a track\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void MIX_UntagTrack(MIX_Track *track, const char *tag);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A tag can be any valid C string in UTF-8 encoding\[char46] It can be useful to
group tracks in various ways\[char46] For example, everything in-game might be
marked as "game", so when the user brings up the settings menu, the app can
pause all tracks involved in gameplay at once, but keep background music
and menu sound effects running\[char46]

It's legal to remove a tag that the track doesn't have; this function
doesn't report errors, so this simply does nothing\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY

.SH AVAILABILITY
