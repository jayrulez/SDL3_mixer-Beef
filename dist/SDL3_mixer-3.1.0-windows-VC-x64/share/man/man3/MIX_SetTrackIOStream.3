.SH NAME
MIX_SetTrackIOStream \- Set a 
.BR MIX_Track
's input to an SDL_IOStream\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_SetTrackIOStream(MIX_Track *track, SDL_IOStream *io, bool closeio);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is not the recommended way to set a track's input, but this can be
useful for a very specific scenario: a large file, to be played once, that
must be read from disk in small chunks as needed\[char46] In most cases, however,
it is preferable to create a 
.BR MIX_Audio
 ahead of time and use

.BR MIX_SetTrackAudio
() instead\[char46]

The stream supplied here should provide an audio file in a supported
format\[char46] SDL_mixer will parse it during this call to make sure it's valid,
and then will read file data from the stream as it needs to decode more
during mixing\[char46]

The stream must be able to seek through the complete set of data, or this
function will fail\[char46]

A given IOStream may only be assigned to a single track at a time;
duplicate assignments won't return an error, but assigning a stream to
multiple tracks will cause each track to read from the stream arbitrarily,
causing confusion, incorrect mixing, or failure to decode\[char46]

Once a track has a valid input, it can start mixing sound by calling

.BR MIX_PlayTrack
(), or possibly 
.BR MIX_PlayTag
()\[char46]

Calling this function with a NULL stream is legal, and removes any input
from the track\[char46] If the track was currently playing, the next time the mixer
runs, it'll notice this and mark the track as stopped, calling any assigned

.BR MIX_TrackStoppedCallback
\[char46]

It is legal to change the input of a track while it's playing, however some
states, like loop points, may cease to make sense with the new audio\[char46] In
such a case, one can call 
.BR MIX_PlayTrack
 again to adjust
parameters\[char46]

The provided stream must remain valid until the track no longer needs it
(either by changing the track's input or destroying the track)\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track on which to set a new audio input\[char46]
.TP
.I io
the new i/o stream to use as the track's input\[char46]
.TP
.I closeio
if true, close the stream when done with it\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success, false on error; call SDL_GetError() for
details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
