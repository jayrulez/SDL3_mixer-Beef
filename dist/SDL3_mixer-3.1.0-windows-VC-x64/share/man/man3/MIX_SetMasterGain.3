.SH NAME
MIX_SetMasterGain \- Set a mixer's master gain control\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_SetMasterGain(MIX_Mixer *mixer, float gain);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each mixer has a master gain, to adjust the volume of the entire mix\[char46] Each
sample passing through the pipeline is modulated by this gain value\[char46] A gain
of zero will generate silence, 1\[char46]0f will not change the mixed volume, and
larger than 1\[char46]0f will increase the volume\[char46] Negative values are illegal\[char46]
There is no maximum gain specified, but this can quickly get extremely
loud, so please be careful with this setting\[char46]

A mixer's master gain defaults to 1\[char46]0f\[char46]

This value can be changed at any time to adjust the future mix\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mixer
the mixer to adjust\[char46]
.TP
.I gain
the new gain value\[char46]
