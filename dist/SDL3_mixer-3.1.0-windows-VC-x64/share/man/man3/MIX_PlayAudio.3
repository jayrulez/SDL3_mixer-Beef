.TH MIX_PlayAudio 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_PlayAudio \- Play a 
.BR MIX_Audio
 from start to finish without any management\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_PlayAudio(MIX_Mixer *mixer, MIX_Audio *audio);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is what we term a "fire-and-forget" sound\[char46] Internally, SDL_mixer will
manage a temporary track to mix the specified 
.BR MIX_Audio
,
cleaning it up when complete\[char46] No options can be provided for how to do the
mixing, like 
.BR MIX_PlayTrack
() offers, and since the track
is not available to the caller, no adjustments can be made to mixing over
time\[char46]

This is not the function to build an entire game of any complexity around,
but it can be convenient to play simple, one-off sounds that can't be
stopped early\[char46] An example would be a voice saying "GAME OVER" during an
unpausable endgame sequence\[char46]

There are no limits to the number of fire-and-forget sounds that can mix at
once (short of running out of memory), and SDL_mixer keeps an internal pool
of temporary tracks it creates as needed and reuses when available\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mixer
the mixer on which to play this audio\[char46]
.TP
.I audio
the audio input to play\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true if the track has begun mixing, false on error; call
SDL_GetError() for details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
