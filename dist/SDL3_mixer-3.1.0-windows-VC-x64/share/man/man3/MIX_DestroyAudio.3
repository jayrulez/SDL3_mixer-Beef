.TH MIX_DestroyAudio 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_DestroyAudio \- Destroy the specified audio\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void MIX_DestroyAudio(MIX_Audio *audio);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR MIX_Audio
 is reference-counted internally, so this function
only unrefs it\[char46] If doing so causes the reference count to drop to zero, the

.BR MIX_Audio
 will be deallocated\[char46] This allows the system to
safely operate if the audio is still assigned to a 
.BR MIX_Track

at the time of destruction\[char46] The actual destroying will happen when the
track stops using it\[char46]

But from the caller's perspective, once this function is called, it should
assume the
.BR audio
pointer has become invalid\[char46]

Destroying a NULL 
.BR MIX_Audio
 is a legal no-op\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I audio
the audio to destroy\[char46]
.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
