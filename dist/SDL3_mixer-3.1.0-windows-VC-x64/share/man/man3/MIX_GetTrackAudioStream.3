.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_AudioStream * MIX_GetTrackAudioStream(MIX_Track *track);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This returns the SDL_AudioStream object currently assigned to
.BR track
through a call to 
.BR MIX_SetTrackAudioStream
()\[char46] If
there is none assigned, or the track has an input that isn't an
SDL_AudioStream (such as a 
.BR MIX_Audio
 or SDL_IOStream), this
will return NULL\[char46]

On various errors (
.BR MIX_Init
() was not called, the track is
NULL), this returns NULL, but there is no mechanism to distinguish errors
from tracks without a valid input\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an SDL_AudioStream if available, NULL if not\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
