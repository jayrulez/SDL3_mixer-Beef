.TH MIX_TrackMixCallback 3type "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 DATATYPES"
.SH NAME
MIX_TrackMixCallback \- A callback that fires when a 
.BR MIX_Track
 is mixing at various stages\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "typedef void (SDLCALL *MIX_TrackMixCallback)(void *userdata, MIX_Track *track, const SDL_AudioSpec *spec, float *pcm, int samples);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This callback is fired for different parts of the mixing pipeline, and
gives the app visbility into the audio data that is being generated at
various stages\[char46]

The audio data passed through here is _not_ const data; the app is
permitted to change it in any way it likes, and those changes will
propagate through the mixing pipeline\[char46]

An audiospec is provided\[char46] Different tracks might be in different formats,
and an app needs to be able to handle that, but SDL_mixer always does its
mixing work in 32-bit float samples, even if the inputs or final output are
not floating point\[char46] As such,
.BR spec->format
will always be
.BR SDL_AUDIO_F32
and
.BR pcm
hardcoded to be a float pointer\[char46]
.BR samples
is the number of float values pointed to by
.BR pcm
: samples, not
sample frames! There are no promises how many samples will be provided
per-callback, and this number can vary wildly from call to call, depending
on many factors\[char46]

Making changes to the track during this callback is undefined behavior\[char46]
Change the data in
.BR pcm
but not the track itself\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I userdata
an opaque pointer provided by the app for its personal use\[char46]
.TP
.I track
the track that is being mixed\[char46]
.TP
.I spec
the format of the data in
.BR pcm
\[char46]
.TP
.I pcm
the raw PCM data in float32 format\[char46]
.TP
.I samples
the number of float values pointed to by
.BR pcm
\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This datatype is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
