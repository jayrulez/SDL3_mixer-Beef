.TH MIX_SetTrackStoppedCallback 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_SetTrackStoppedCallback \- Set a callback that fires when a 
.BR MIX_Track
 is stopped\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_SetTrackStoppedCallback(MIX_Track *track, MIX_TrackStoppedCallback cb, void *userdata);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
When a track completes playback, either because it ran out of data to mix
(and all loops were completed as well), or it was explicitly stopped by the
app, it will fire the callback specified here\[char46]

Each track has its own unique callback\[char46]

Passing a NULL callback here is legal; it disables this track's callback\[char46]

Pausing a track will not fire the callback, nor will the callback fire on a
playing track that is being destroyed\[char46]

It is legal to adjust the track, including changing its input and
restarting it\[char46] If this is done because it ran out of data in the middle of
mixing, the mixer will start mixing the new track state in its current run
without any gap in the audio\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track to assign this callback to\[char46]
.TP
.I cb
the function to call when the track stops\[char46] May be NULL\[char46]
.TP
.I userdata
an opaque pointer provided to the callback for its own personal use\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
