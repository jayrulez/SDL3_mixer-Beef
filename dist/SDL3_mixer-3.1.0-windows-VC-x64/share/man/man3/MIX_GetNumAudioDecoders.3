.SH DESCRIPTION
An audio decoder is what turns specific audio file formats into usable PCM
data\[char46] For example, there might be an MP3 decoder, or a WAV decoder, etc\[char46]
SDL_mixer probably has several decoders built in\[char46]

The return value can be used to call

.BR MIX_GetAudioDecoder
() in a loop\[char46]

The number of decoders available is decided during 
.BR MIX_Init
()
and does not change until the library is deinitialized\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of decoders available\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
