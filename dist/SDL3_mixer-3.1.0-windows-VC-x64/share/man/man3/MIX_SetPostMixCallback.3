.PP
.BI "bool MIX_SetPostMixCallback(MIX_Mixer *mixer, MIX_PostMixCallback cb, void *userdata);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
After all mixer groups have processed, their buffers are mixed together
into a single buffer for the final output, at which point a callback can be
fired\[char46] This lets an app view the data at the last moment before mixing
completes\[char46] It can also change the data in any way it pleases during this
callback, and the mixer will continue as if this data is the final output\[char46]

Each mixer has its own unique callback\[char46]

Passing a NULL callback here is legal; it disables this mixer's callback\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mixer
the mixer to assign this callback to\[char46]
.TP
.I cb
the function to call when the mixer mixes\[char46] May be NULL\[char46]
.TP
.I userdata
an opaque pointer provided to the callback for its own personal use\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
