.SH NAME
MIX_GetTrackFrequencyRatio \- Query the frequency ratio of a track\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "float MIX_GetTrackFrequencyRatio(MIX_Track *track);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The frequency ratio is used to adjust the rate at which audio data is
consumed\[char46] Changing this effectively modifies the speed and pitch of the
track's audio\[char46] A value greater than 1\[char46]0f will play the audio faster, and at
a higher pitch\[char46] A value less than 1\[char46]0f will play the audio slower, and at a
lower pitch\[char46] 1\[char46]0f is normal speed\[char46]

The default value is 1\[char46]0f\[char46]

On various errors (
.BR MIX_Init
() was not called, the track is
NULL), this returns 0\[char46]0f\[char46] Since this is not a valid value to set, this can
be seen as an error state\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track on which to query the frequency ratio\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the current frequency ratio, or 0\[char46]0f on failure; call
SDL_GetError() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
