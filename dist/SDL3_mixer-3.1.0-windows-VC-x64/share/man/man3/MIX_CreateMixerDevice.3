.SH NAME
MIX_CreateMixerDevice \- Create a mixer that plays sound directly to an audio device\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "MIX_Mixer * MIX_CreateMixerDevice(SDL_AudioDeviceID devid, const SDL_AudioSpec *spec);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is usually the function you want, vs

.BR MIX_CreateMixer
()\[char46]

You can choose a specific device ID to open, following SDL's usual rules,
but often the correct choice is to specify
SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK and let SDL figure out what device to use
(and seamlessly transition you to new hardware if the default changes)\[char46]

Only playback devices make sense here\[char46] Attempting to open a recording
device will fail\[char46]

This will call SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_AUDIO) internally; it's safe to call
SDL_Init() before this call, too, if you intend to enumerate audio devices
to choose one to open here\[char46]

An audio format can be requested, and the system will try to set the
hardware to those specifications, or as close as possible, but this is just
a hint\[char46] SDL_mixer will handle all data conversion behind the scenes in any
case, and specifying a NULL spec is a reasonable choice\[char46] The best reason to
specify a format is because you know all your data is in that format and it
might save some unnecessary CPU time on conversion\[char46]

The actual device format chosen is available through

.BR MIX_GetMixerFormat
()\[char46]

Once a mixer is created, next steps are usually to load audio (through

.BR MIX_LoadAudio
() and friends), create a track
(
.BR MIX_CreateTrack
()), and play that audio through that
track\[char46]

When done with the mixer, it can be destroyed with

.BR MIX_DestroyMixer
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I devid
the device to open for playback, or SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK for the default\[char46]
.TP
.I spec
the audio format request from the device\[char46] May be NULL\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR MIX_Mixer
 *) Returns a mixer that can be used to play audio,
or NULL on failure; call SDL_GetError() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
