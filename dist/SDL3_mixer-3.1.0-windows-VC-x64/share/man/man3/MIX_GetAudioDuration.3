.SH DESCRIPTION
This information is also available via the

.BR MIX_PROP_METADATA_DURATION_FRAMES_NUMBER

property, but it's common enough to provide a simple accessor function\[char46]

This reports the length of the data in _sample frames_, so sample-perfect
mixing can be possible\[char46] Sample frames are only meaningful as a measure of
time if the sample rate (frequency) is also known\[char46] To convert from sample
frames to milliseconds, use 
.BR MIX_AudioFramesToMS
()\[char46]

Not all audio file formats can report the complete length of the data they
will produce through decoding: some can't calculate it, some might produce
infinite audio\[char46]

Also, some file formats can only report duration as a unit of time, which
means SDL_mixer might have to estimate sample frames from that information\[char46]
With less precision, the reported duration might be off by a few sample
frames in either direction\[char46]

This will return a value >= 0 if a duration is known\[char46] It might also return

.BR MIX_DURATION_UNKNOWN
 or

.BR MIX_DURATION_INFINITE
\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I audio
the audio to query\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the length of the audio in sample frames, or

.BR MIX_DURATION_UNKNOWN
 or

.BR MIX_DURATION_INFINITE
\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
