.SH NAME
MIX_CreateAudioDecoder \- Create a 
.BR MIX_AudioDecoder
 from a path on the filesystem\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "MIX_AudioDecoder * MIX_CreateAudioDecoder(const char *path, SDL_PropertiesID props);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Most apps won't need this, as SDL_mixer's usual interfaces will decode
audio as needed\[char46] However, if one wants to decode an audio file into a
memory buffer without playing it, this interface offers that\[char46]

This function allows properties to be specified\[char46] This is intended to supply
file-specific settings, such as where to find SoundFonts for a MIDI file,
etc\[char46] In most cases, the caller should pass a zero to specify no extra
properties\[char46]

When done with the audio decoder, it can be destroyed with

.BR MIX_DestroyAudioDecoder
()\[char46]

This function requires SDL_mixer to have been initialized with a successful
call to 
.BR MIX_Init
(), but does not need an actual

.BR MIX_Mixer
 to have been created\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I path
the path on the filesystem from which to load data\[char46]
.TP
.I props
decoder-specific properties\[char46] May be zero\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR MIX_AudioDecoder
 *) Returns an audio decoder, ready to
decode\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
