.SH NAME
MIX_GetAudioDecoder \- Report the name of a specific audio decoders\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "const char * MIX_GetAudioDecoder(int index);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
An audio decoder is what turns specific audio file formats into usable PCM
data\[char46] For example, there might be an MP3 decoder, or a WAV decoder, etc\[char46]
SDL_mixer probably has several decoders built in\[char46]

The names are capital English letters and numbers, low-ASCII\[char46] They don't
necessarily map to a specific file format; Some decoders, like "XMP"
operate on multiple file types, and more than one decoder might handle the
same file type, like "DRMP3" vs "MPG123"\[char46] Note that in that last example,
neither decoder is called "MP3"\[char46]

The index of a specific decoder is decided during 
.BR MIX_Init
()
and does not change until the library is deinitialized\[char46] Valid indices are
between zero and the return value of

.BR MIX_GetNumAudioDecoders
()\[char46]

The returned pointer is const memory owned by SDL_mixer; do not free it\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I index
the index of the decoder to query\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a UTF-8 (really, ASCII) string of the decoder's
name, or NULL if
.BR index
is invalid\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
