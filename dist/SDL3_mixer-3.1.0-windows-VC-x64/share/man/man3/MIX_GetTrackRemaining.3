.TH MIX_GetTrackRemaining 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_GetTrackRemaining \- Return the number of sample frames remaining to be mixed in a track\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Sint64 MIX_GetTrackRemaining(MIX_Track *track);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the track is playing or paused, and its total duration is known, this
will report how much audio is left to mix\[char46] If the track is playing, future
calls to this function will report different values\[char46]

Remaining audio is defined in _sample frames_ of decoded audio, not units
of time, so that sample-perfect mixing can be achieved\[char46] To instead operate
in units of time, use 
.BR MIX_TrackFramesToMS
() to
convert the return value to milliseconds\[char46]

This function does not take into account fade-outs or looping, just the
current mixing position vs the duration of the track\[char46]

If the duration of the track isn't known, or
.BR track
is NULL, this function
returns -1\[char46] A stopped track reports 0\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track to query\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the total sample frames still to be mixed, or -1 if
unknown\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
