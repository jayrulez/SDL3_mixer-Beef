.SH NAME
MIX_SetTrackOutputChannelMap \- Set the current output channel map of a track\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_SetTrackOutputChannelMap(MIX_Track *track, const int *chmap, int count);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Channel maps are optional; most things do not need them, instead passing
data in the order that SDL expects\[char46]

The output channel map reorders track data after transformations and before
it is mixed into a mixer group\[char46] This can be useful for reversing stereo
channels, for example\[char46]

Each item in the array represents an input channel, and its value is the
channel that it should be remapped to\[char46] To reverse a stereo signal's left
and right values, you'd have an array of
.BR { 1, 0 }
\[char46] It is legal to remap
multiple channels to the same thing, so
.BR { 1, 1 }
would duplicate the
right channel to both channels of a stereo signal\[char46] An element in the
channel map set to -1 instead of a valid channel will mute that channel,
setting it to a silence value\[char46]

You cannot change the number of channels through a channel map, just
reorder/mute them\[char46]

Tracks default to no remapping applied\[char46] Passing a NULL channel map is
legal, and turns off remapping\[char46]

SDL_mixer will copy the channel map; the caller does not have to save this
array after this call\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track to change\[char46]
.TP
.I chmap
the new channel map, NULL to reset to default\[char46]
.TP
.I count
The number of channels in the map\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
