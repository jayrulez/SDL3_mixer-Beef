.SH NAME
MIX_StopTrack \- Halt a currently-playing track, possibly fading out over time\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_StopTrack(MIX_Track *track, Sint64 fade_out_frames);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If
.BR fade_out_frames
is > 0, the track does not stop mixing immediately,
but rather fades to silence over that many sample frames before stopping\[char46]
Sample frames are specific to the input assigned to the track, to allow for
sample-perfect mixing\[char46] 
.BR MIX_TrackMSToFrames
() can be
used to convert milliseconds to an appropriate value here\[char46]

If the track ends normally while the fade-out is still in progress, the
audio stops there; the fade is not adjusted to be shorter if it will last
longer than the audio remaining\[char46]

Once a track has completed any fadeout and come to a stop, it will call its

.BR MIX_TrackStoppedCallback
, if any\[char46] It is legal
to assign the track a new input and/or restart it during this callback\[char46]

It is legal to halt a track that's already stopped\[char46] It does nothing, and
returns true\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track to halt\[char46]
.TP
.I fade_out_frames
the number of sample frames to spend fading out to silence before halting\[char46] 0 to stop immediately\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true if the track has stopped, false on error; call
SDL_GetError() for details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
