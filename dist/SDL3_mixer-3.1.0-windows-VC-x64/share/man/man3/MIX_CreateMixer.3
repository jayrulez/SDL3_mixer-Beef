.SH DESCRIPTION
Usually you want 
.BR MIX_CreateMixerDevice
() instead
of this function\[char46] The mixer created here can be used with

.BR MIX_Generate
() to produce more data on demand, as fast as
desired\[char46]

This cannot be NULL\[char46]

Once a mixer is created, next steps are usually to load audio (through

.BR MIX_LoadAudio
() and friends), create a track
(
.BR MIX_CreateTrack
()), and play that audio through that
track\[char46]

When done with the mixer, it can be destroyed with

.BR MIX_DestroyMixer
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I spec
