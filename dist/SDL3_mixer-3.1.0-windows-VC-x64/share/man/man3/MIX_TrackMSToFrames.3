.TH MIX_TrackMSToFrames 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_TrackMSToFrames \- Convert milliseconds to sample frames for a track's current format\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Sint64 MIX_TrackMSToFrames(MIX_Track *track, Sint64 ms);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This calculates time based on the track's current input format, which can
change when its input does, and also if that input changes formats
mid-stream (for example, if decoding a file that is two MP3s concatenated
together)\[char46]

On various errors (
.BR MIX_Init
() was not called, the track is
NULL), this returns -1\[char46] If the track has no input, this returns -1\[char46] If
.BR ms
is < 0, this returns -1\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track to query\[char46]
.TP
.I ms
the milliseconds to convert to track-specific sample frames\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns Converted number of sample frames, or -1 for errors/no
input; call SDL_GetError() for details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
