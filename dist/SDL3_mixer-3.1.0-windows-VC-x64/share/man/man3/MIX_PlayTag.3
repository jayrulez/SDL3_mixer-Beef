.TH MIX_PlayTag 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_PlayTag \- Start (or restart) mixing all tracks with a specific tag for playback\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_PlayTag(MIX_Mixer *mixer, const char *tag, SDL_PropertiesID options);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function follows all the same rules as

.BR MIX_PlayTrack
(); please refer to its documentation for the
details\[char46] Unlike that function, 
.BR MIX_PlayTag
() operates on
multiple tracks at once that have the specified tag applied, via

.BR MIX_TagTrack
()\[char46]

If all of your tagged tracks have different sample rates, it would make
sense to use the
.BR
.I _MILLISECONDS_NUMBER
properties in your
.BR options
,
instead of
.BR 
_FRAMES_NUMBER
, and let SDL_mixer figure out how to apply it
to each track\[char46]

This function returns true if all tagged tracks are started (or restarted)\[char46]
If any track fails, this function returns false, but all tracks that could
start will still be started even when this function reports failure\[char46]

From the point of view of the mixing process, all tracks that successfully
(re)start will do so at the exact same moment\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mixer
the mixer on which to look for tagged tracks\[char46]
.TP
.I tag
the tag to use when searching for tracks\[char46]
.TP
.I options
the set of options that will be applied to each track\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success, false on error; call SDL_GetError() for
details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
