.TH MIX_Quit 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_Quit \- Deinitialize the SDL_mixer library\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void MIX_Quit(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This must be called when done with the library, probably at the end of your
program\[char46]

It is safe to call this multiple times; the library will only deinitialize
once, when this function is called the same number of times as

.BR MIX_Init
 was successfully called\[char46]

Once you have successfully deinitialized the library, it is safe to call

.BR MIX_Init
 to reinitialize it for further use\[char46]

On successful deinitialization, SDL_mixer will destroy almost all created
objects, including objects of type:


\(bu 
.BR MIX_Mixer


\(bu 
.BR MIX_Track


\(bu 
.BR MIX_Audio


\(bu 
.BR MIX_Group


\(bu 
.BR MIX_AudioDecoder


\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]which is to say: it's possible a single call to this function will clean
up anything it allocated, stop all audio output, close audio devices, etc\[char46]
Don't attempt to destroy objects after this call\[char46] The app is still
encouraged to manage their resources carefully and clean up first, treating
this function as a safety net against memory leaks\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR \(bu (3),
.BR MIX_Init (3)
