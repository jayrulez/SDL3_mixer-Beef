.TH MIX_TagTrack 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_TagTrack \- Assign an arbitrary tag to a track\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_TagTrack(MIX_Track *track, const char *tag);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A tag can be any valid C string in UTF-8 encoding\[char46] It can be useful to
group tracks in various ways\[char46] For example, everything in-game might be
marked as "game", so when the user brings up the settings menu, the app can
pause all tracks involved in gameplay at once, but keep background music
and menu sound effects running\[char46]

A track can have as many tags as desired, until the machine runs out of
memory\[char46]

It's legal to add the same tag to a track more than once; the extra
attempts will report success but not change anything\[char46]

Tags can later be removed with 
.BR MIX_UntagTrack
()\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
