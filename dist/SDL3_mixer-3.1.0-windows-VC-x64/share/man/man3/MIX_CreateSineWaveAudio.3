.TH MIX_CreateSineWaveAudio 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_CreateSineWaveAudio \- Create a 
.BR MIX_Audio
 that generates a sinewave\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "MIX_Audio * MIX_CreateSineWaveAudio(MIX_Mixer *mixer, int hz, float amplitude);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is useful just to have _something_ to play, perhaps for testing or
debugging purposes\[char46]

The resulting 
.BR MIX_Audio
 will generate infinite audio when
assigned to a track\[char46]

You specify its frequency in Hz (determines the pitch of the sinewave's
audio) and amplitude (determines the volume of the sinewave: 1\[char46]0f is very
loud, 0\[char46]0f is silent)\[char46]


.BR MIX_Audio
 objects can be shared between multiple mixers\[char46] The
.BR mixer
parameter just suggests the most likely mixer to use this audio, in
case some optimization might be applied, but this is not required, and a
NULL mixer may be specified\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mixer
a mixer this audio is intended to be used with\[char46] May be NULL\[char46]
.TP
.I hz
the sinewave's frequency in Hz\[char46]
.TP
.I amplitude
the sinewave's amplitude from 0\[char46]0f to 1\[char46]0f\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR MIX_Audio
 *) Returns an audio object that can be used to make
sound on a mixer, or NULL on failure; call SDL_GetError() for more
information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
