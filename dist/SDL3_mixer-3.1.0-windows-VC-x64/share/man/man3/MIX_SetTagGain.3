.SH NAME
MIX_SetTagGain \- Set the gain control of all tracks with a specific tag\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_SetTagGain(MIX_Mixer *mixer, const char *tag, float gain);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each track has its own gain, to adjust its overall volume\[char46] Each sample from
this track is modulated by this gain value\[char46] A gain of zero will generate
silence, 1\[char46]0f will not change the mixed volume, and larger than 1\[char46]0f will
increase the volume\[char46] Negative values are illegal\[char46] There is no maximum gain
specified, but this can quickly get extremely loud, so please be careful
with this setting\[char46]

A track's gain defaults to 1\[char46]0f\[char46]

This will change the gain control on tracks on the specified mixer that
have the specified tag\[char46]

From the point of view of the mixing process, all tracks that successfully
change gain values will do so at the exact same moment\[char46]

This value can be changed at any time to adjust the future mix\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mixer
the mixer on which to look for tagged tracks\[char46]
.TP
.I tag
the tag to use when searching for tracks\[char46]
.TP
.I gain
the new gain value\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
