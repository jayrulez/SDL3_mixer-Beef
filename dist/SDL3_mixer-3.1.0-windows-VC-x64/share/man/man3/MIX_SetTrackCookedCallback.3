.TH MIX_SetTrackCookedCallback 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_SetTrackCookedCallback \- Set a callback that fires when the mixer has transformed a track's audio\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_SetTrackCookedCallback(MIX_Track *track, MIX_TrackMixCallback cb, void *userdata);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
As a track needs to mix more data, it pulls from its input (a

.BR MIX_Audio
, an SDL_AudioStream, etc)\[char46] This input might be a
compressed file format, like MP3, so a little more data is uncompressed
from it\[char46]

Once the track has PCM data to start operating on, and its raw callback has
completed, it will begin to transform the audio: gain, fading, frequency
ratio, 3D positioning, etc\[char46]

A callback can be fired after all these transformations, but before the
transformed data is mixed into other tracks\[char46] This lets an app view the data
at the last moment that it is still a part of this track\[char46] It can also
change the data in any way it pleases during this callback, and the mixer
will continue as if this data came directly from the input\[char46]

Each track has its own unique cooked callback\[char46]

Passing a NULL callback here is legal; it disables this track's callback\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track to assign this callback to\[char46]
.TP
.I cb
the function to call when the track mixes\[char46] May be NULL\[char46]
.TP
.I userdata
an opaque pointer provided to the callback for its own personal use\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
