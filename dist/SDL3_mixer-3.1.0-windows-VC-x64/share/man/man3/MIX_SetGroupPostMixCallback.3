.SH DESCRIPTION
After all playing tracks in a mixer group have pulled in more data from
their inputs, transformed it, and mixed together into a single buffer, a
callback can be fired\[char46] This lets an app view the data at the last moment
that it is still a part of this group\[char46] It can also change the data in any
way it pleases during this callback, and the mixer will continue as if this
data came directly from the group's mix buffer\[char46]

Each group has its own unique callback\[char46] Tracks that aren't in an explicit

.BR MIX_Group
 are mixed in an internal grouping that is not
available to the app\[char46]

Passing a NULL callback here is legal; it disables this group's callback\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I group
the mixing group to assign this callback to\[char46]
.TP
.I cb
the function to call when the group mixes\[char46] May be NULL\[char46]
.TP
.I userdata
an opaque pointer provided to the callback for its own personal use\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
