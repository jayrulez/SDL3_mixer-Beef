.SH DESCRIPTION
The track will use whatever input was last assigned to it when playing; an
input must be assigned to this track or this function will fail\[char46] Inputs are
assigned with calls to 
.BR MIX_SetTrackAudio
(),

.BR MIX_SetTrackAudioStream
(), or

.BR MIX_SetTrackIOStream
()\[char46]

If the track is already playing, or paused, this will restart the track
with the newly-specified parameters\[char46]

As there are several parameters, and more may be added in the future, they
are specified with an SDL_PropertiesID\[char46] The parameters have reasonable
defaults, and specifying a 0 for
.BR options
will choose defaults for
everything\[char46]

These are the supported properties:


\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOPS_NUMBER
: The number of
  times to loop the track when it reaches the end\[char46] A value of 1 will loop
  to the start one time\[char46] Zero will not loop at all\[char46] A value of -1 requests
  infinite loops\[char46] If the input is not seekable and this value isn't zero,
  this function will report success but the track will stop at the point it
  should loop\[char46] Default 0\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_MAX_FRAME_NUMBER
: Mix
  at most to this sample frame position in the track\[char46] This will be treated
  as if the input reach EOF at this point in the audio file\[char46] If -1, mix all
  available audio without a limit\[char46] Default -1\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_MAX_MILLISECONDS_NUMBER
:
  The same as using the
  
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_MAX_FRAME_NUMBER

  property, but the value is specified in milliseconds instead of sample
  frames\[char46] If both properties are specified, the sample frames value is
  favored\[char46] Default -1\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_FRAME_NUMBER
:
  Start mixing from this sample frame position in the track's input\[char46] A
  value <= 0 will begin from the start of the track's input\[char46] If the input
  is not seekable and this value is > 0, this function will report failure\[char46]
  Default 0\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_MILLISECOND_NUMBER
:
  The same as using the
  
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_FRAME_NUMBER

  property, but the value is specified in milliseconds instead of sample
  frames\[char46] If both properties are specified, the sample frames value is
  favored\[char46] Default 0\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOP_START_FRAME_NUMBER
:
  If the track is looping, this is the sample frame position that the track
  will loop back to; this lets one play an intro at the start of a track on
  the first iteration, but have a loop point somewhere in the middle
  thereafter\[char46] A value <= 0 will begin the loop from the start of the
  track's input\[char46] Default 0\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOP_START_MILLISECOND_NUMBER
:
  The same as using the
  
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOP_START_FRAME_NUMBER

  property, but the value is specified in milliseconds instead of sample
  frames\[char46] If both properties are specified, the sample frames value is
  favored\[char46] Default 0\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_FADE_IN_FRAMES_NUMBER
:
  The number of sample frames over which to fade in the newly-started
  track\[char46] The track will begin mixing silence and reach full volume smoothly
  over this many sample frames\[char46] If the track loops before the fade-in is
  complete, it will continue to fade correctly from the loop point\[char46] A value
  <= 0 will disable fade-in, so the track starts mixing at full volume\[char46]
  Default 0\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_FADE_IN_MILLISECONDS_NUMBER
:
  The same as using the
  
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_FADE_IN_FRAMES_NUMBER

  property, but the value is specified in milliseconds instead of sample
  frames\[char46] If both properties are specified, the sample frames value is
  favored\[char46] Default 0\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_APPEND_SILENCE_FRAMES_NUMBER
:
  At the end of mixing this track, after all loops are complete, append
  this many sample frames of silence as if it were part of the audio file\[char46]
  This allows for apps to implement effects in callbacks, like reverb, that
  need to generate samples past the end of the stream's audio, or perhaps
  introduce a delay before starting a new sound on the track without having
  to manage it directly\[char46] A value <= 0 generates no silence before stopping
  the track\[char46] Default 0\[char46]

\(bu 
.BR
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_APPEND_SILENCE_MILLISECONDS_NUMBER
:
  The same as using the
  
.BR MIX_PROP_PLAY_APPEND_SILENCE_FRAMES_NUMBER

  property, but the value is specified in milliseconds instead of sample
  frames\[char46] If both properties are specified, the sample frames value is
  favored\[char46] Default 0\[char46]

If this function fails, mixing of this track will not start (or restart, if
it was already started)\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track to start (or restart) mixing\[char46]
.TP
.I options
a set of properties that control playback\[char46] May be zero\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE

details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
