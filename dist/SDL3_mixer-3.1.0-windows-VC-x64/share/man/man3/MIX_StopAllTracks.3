.TH MIX_StopAllTracks 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_StopAllTracks \- Halt all currently-playing tracks, possibly fading out over time\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_StopAllTracks(MIX_Mixer *mixer, Sint64 fade_out_ms);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If
.BR fade_out_ms
is > 0, the tracks do not stop mixing immediately, but
rather fades to silence over that many milliseconds before stopping\[char46] Note
that this is different than 
.BR MIX_StopTrack
(), which wants
sample frames; this function takes milliseconds because different tracks
might have different sample rates\[char46]

If a track ends normally while the fade-out is still in progress, the audio
stops there; the fade is not adjusted to be shorter if it will last longer
than the audio remaining\[char46]

Once a track has completed any fadeout and come to a stop, it will call its

.BR MIX_TrackStoppedCallback
, if any\[char46] It is legal
to assign the track a new input and/or restart it during this callback\[char46]
This function does not prevent new play requests from being made\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mixer
the mixer on which to stop all tracks\[char46]
.TP
.I fade_out_ms
the number of milliseconds to spend fading out to silence before halting\[char46] 0 to stop immediately\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success, false on error; call SDL_GetError() for
details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
