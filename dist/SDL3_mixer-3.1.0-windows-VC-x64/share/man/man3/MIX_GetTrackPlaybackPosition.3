.SH NAME
MIX_GetTrackPlaybackPosition \- Get the current input position of a playing track\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Sint64 MIX_GetTrackPlaybackPosition(MIX_Track *track);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
(Not to be confused with

.BR MIX_GetTrack3DPosition
(), which is positioning of
the track in 3D space, not the playback position of its audio data\[char46])

Position is defined in _sample frames_ of decoded audio, not units of time,
so that sample-perfect mixing can be achieved\[char46] To instead operate in units
of time, use 
.BR MIX_TrackFramesToMS
() to convert the
return value to milliseconds\[char46]

Stopped and paused tracks will report the position when they halted\[char46]
Playing tracks will report the current position, which will change over
time\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track to change\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the track's current sample frame position, or -1 on error;
call SDL_GetError() for details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
