.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_TrackLooping(MIX_Track *track);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This specifically checks if the track is _not stopped_ (paused or playing),
and there is at least one loop remaining\[char46] If a track _was_ looping but is
on its final iteration of the loop, this will return false\[char46]

On various errors (
.BR MIX_Init
() was not called, the track is
NULL), this returns false, but there is no mechanism to distinguish errors
from non-looping tracks\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true if looping, false otherwise\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
