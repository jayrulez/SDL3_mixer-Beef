.SH NAME
MIX_LoadRawAudioNoCopy \- Load raw PCM data from a memory buffer without making a copy\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "MIX_Audio * MIX_LoadRawAudioNoCopy(MIX_Mixer *mixer, const void *data, size_t datalen, const SDL_AudioSpec *spec, bool free_when_done);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This buffer must live for the entire time the returned

.BR MIX_Audio
 lives, as it will access it whenever it needs to mix
more data\[char46]

This function is meant to maximize efficiency: if the data is already in
memory and can remain there, don't copy it\[char46] But it can also lead to some
interesting tricks, like changing the buffer's contents to alter multiple
playing tracks at once\[char46] (But, of course, be careful when being too clever\[char46])


.BR MIX_Audio
 objects can be shared between multiple mixers\[char46] The
.BR mixer
parameter just suggests the most likely mixer to use this audio, in
case some optimization might be applied, but this is not required, and a
NULL mixer may be specified\[char46]

If
.BR free_when_done
is true, SDL_mixer will call
.BR SDL_free(data)
when the
returned 
.BR MIX_Audio
 is eventually destroyed\[char46] This can be useful
when the data is not static, but rather composed dynamically for this
specific 
.BR MIX_Audio
 and simply wants to avoid the extra copy\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mixer
a mixer this audio is intended to be used with\[char46] May be NULL\[char46]
.TP
.I data
the buffer where the raw PCM data lives\[char46]
.TP
.I datalen
the size, in bytes, of the buffer\[char46]
.TP
.I spec
what format the raw data is in\[char46]
.TP
.I free_when_done
if true,
.BR data
will be given to SDL_free() when the 
.BR MIX_Audio
 is destroyed\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR MIX_Audio
 *) Returns an audio object that can be used to make
sound on a mixer, or NULL on failure; call SDL_GetError() for more
information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
