.SH NAME
MIX_CreateGroup \- Create a mixing group\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "MIX_Group * MIX_CreateGroup(MIX_Mixer *mixer);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Tracks are assigned to a mixing group (or if unassigned, they live in a
mixer's internal default group)\[char46] All tracks in a group are mixed together
and the app can access this mixed data before it is mixed with all other
groups to produce the final output\[char46]

This can be a useful feature, but is completely optional; apps can ignore
mixing groups entirely and still have a full experience with SDL_mixer\[char46]

After creating a group, assign tracks to it with

.BR MIX_SetTrackGroup
()\[char46] Use

.BR MIX_SetGroupPostMixCallback
() to access the
group's mixed data\[char46]

A mixing group can be destroyed with 
.BR MIX_DestroyGroup
()
when no longer needed\[char46] Destroying the mixer will also destroy all its
still-existing mixing groups\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mixer
the mixer on which to create a mixing group\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE

.SH THREAD SAFETY

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
