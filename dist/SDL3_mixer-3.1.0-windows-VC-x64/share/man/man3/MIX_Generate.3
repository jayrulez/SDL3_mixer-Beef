.TH MIX_Generate 3 "SDL_mixer 3.1.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
MIX_Generate \- Generate mixer output when not driving an audio device\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_Generate(MIX_Mixer *mixer, void *buffer, int buflen);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
SDL_mixer allows the creation of 
.BR MIX_Mixer
 objects that are
not connected to an audio device, by calling

.BR MIX_CreateMixer
() instead of

.BR MIX_CreateMixerDevice
()\[char46] Such mixers will not
generate output until explicitly requested through this function\[char46]

The caller may request as much audio as desired, so long as
.BR buflen
is a
multiple of the sample frame size specified when creating the mixer (for
example, if requesting stereo Sint16 audio, buflen must be a multiple of 4:
2 bytes-per-channel times 2 channels)\[char46]

The mixer will mix as quickly as possible; since it works in sample frames
instead of time, it can potentially generate enormous amounts of audio in a
small amount of time\[char46]

On success, this always fills
.BR buffer
with
.BR buflen
bytes of audio; if all
playing tracks finish mixing, it will fill the remaining buffer with
silence\[char46]

Each call to this function will pick up where it left off, playing tracks
will continue to mix from the point the previous call completed, etc\[char46] The
mixer state can be changed between each call in any way desired: tracks can
be added, played, stopped, changed, removed, etc\[char46] Effectively this function
does the same thing SDL_mixer does internally when the audio device needs
more audio to play\[char46]

This function can not be used with mixers from

.BR MIX_CreateMixerDevice
(); those generate audio as
needed internally\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mixer
the mixer for which to generate more audio\[char46]
.TP
.I buffer
a pointer to a buffer to store audio in\[char46]
.TP
.I buflen
the number of bytes to store in buffer\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
