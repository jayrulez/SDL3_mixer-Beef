.SH NAME
MIX_SetTrackAudioStream \- Set a 
.BR MIX_Track
's input to an SDL_AudioStream\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_SetTrackAudioStream(MIX_Track *track, SDL_AudioStream *stream);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Using an audio stream allows the application to generate any type of audio,
in any format, possibly procedurally or on-demand, and mix in with all
other tracks\[char46]

When a track uses an audio stream, it will call SDL_GetAudioStreamData as
it needs more audio to mix\[char46] The app can either buffer data to the stream
ahead of time, or set a callback on the stream to provide data as needed\[char46]
Please refer to SDL's documentation for details\[char46]

A given audio stream may only be assigned to a single track at a time;
duplicate assignments won't return an error, but assigning a stream to
multiple tracks will cause each track to read from the stream arbitrarily,
causing confusion and incorrect mixing\[char46]

Once a track has a valid input, it can start mixing sound by calling

.BR MIX_PlayTrack
(), or possibly 
.BR MIX_PlayTag
()\[char46]

Calling this function with a NULL audio stream is legal, and removes any
input from the track\[char46] If the track was currently playing, the next time the
mixer runs, it'll notice this and mark the track as stopped, calling any
assigned 
.BR MIX_TrackStoppedCallback
\[char46]

It is legal to change the input of a track while it's playing, however some
states, like loop points, may cease to make sense with the new audio\[char46] In
such a case, one can call 
.BR MIX_PlayTrack
 again to adjust
parameters\[char46]

The provided audio stream must remain valid until the track no longer needs
it (either by changing the track's input or destroying the track)\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track on which to set a new audio input\[char46]
.TP
.I stream
the audio stream to use as the track's input\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success, false on error; call SDL_GetError() for
details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
